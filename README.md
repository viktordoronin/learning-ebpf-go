# learning-ebpf-go
In this project, I will rewrite (O'Reily's "Learning eBPF" code examples)[https://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf] into Go, complete with exercises where applicable. Each example is set up as its own package. Run `TODO` to compile everything; to compile an individual example, run `TODO` while inside that folder. Userspace examples are rewritten based on my own expertise and thanks to (ebpf-go documentation)[https://github.com/cilium/ebpf?tab=readme-ov-file#packages]; eBPF code is rewritten for libbpf based on the book's explanations, considerations from [here](https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2020/02/20/bcc-to-libbpf-howto-guide.html) and a bit of information from [here](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/4404).

Thanks to:(TODO: add links)
