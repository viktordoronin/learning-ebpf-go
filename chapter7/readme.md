# Chapter 7
This chapter showcases different types of eBPF programs, and my code showcases how to handle them in Go. Some explanations in the comments.
`bpf2go` makes you load the whole thing at once, so if there's some unsupported programs in the eBPF code, the whole loading process fails. This forced me to comment out the Fentry code as it's not supported on my system. The only approach I was able to find(not implemented) is to implement the programs in separate files, which will make it compile to separate ELFs, then use `feature.HaveProgramType()` to check if it's available and load it if so.
